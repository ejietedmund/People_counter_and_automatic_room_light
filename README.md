# People_counter_and_automatic_room_light
#This is a simple people counter project and automatic room light that is implemented using Arduino nano esp32, two ultrasonic sensors(URM09), one I2C LCD display and bread board
#This setup counts people entering in and exiting a given entrance and displays the results on the lcd display and when number of people in the room are morethan one the room light automatically goes on and goes off when there's no person in the room
#This setup can also be monitered on phone connected via Bluetooth, where what ever is displayed on lcd  is also displayed on serial monitor terminal and the light can be manually controlled here by using commands to activate manual mode for light control and using led_off and led_on commands to manually control the light.
